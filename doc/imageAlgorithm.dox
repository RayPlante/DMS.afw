\section secForEachPixel Apply a functor to each pixel in an Image

@c afw supports @c for_each_pixel as a way to process each pixel in an Image, in a similar way to the STL's @c
for_each.  The name doesn't follow the LSST C++ guidelines, but in this case I felt that conformity to the
spirit of the STL was more important.  There are four variants of @c for_each_pixel corresponding to setting a
pixel to a function, setting it to a function of its initial value or of another Image, and setting it to a
function of its value and a second Image's pixel value.  The selection of which of these operations is desired
is done by requiring the functor to inherit from one of @c pixelOp0, @c pixelOp1 or @c pixelOp2, each of which
is a @c tr1::function with a virtual @c operator() added.

<DL>
<DT> <TT>for_each_pixel(Image<LhsT> &lhs, pixelOp0<LhsT> const& func)</TT>
<DD> Set each pixel in @c lhs to the value of func.

<DT> <TT>for_each_pixel(Image<LhsT> &lhs, pixelOp1<LhsT> const& func)</TT>
<DD> Set each pixel in @c lhs to the value of <TT>func(lhs)</TT>.

<DT> <TT>for_each_pixel(Image<LhsT> &lhs, Image<RhsT> const& rhs, pixelOp1<RhsT> const& func)</TT>
<DD> Set each pixel in @c lhs to the value of <TT>func(lhs)</TT>.

<DT> <TT>for_each_pixel(Image<LhsT> &lhs, Image<RhsT> const& rhs, pixelOp2<Lhs, RhsT> const& func)</TT>
<DD> Set each pixel in @c lhs to the value of <TT>func(lhs, rhs)</TT>.

\subsection secForEachPixelExample Example of using for_each_pixel

This code is in \link forEachPixel.cc\endlink.

\dontinclude forEachPixel.cc

\skip ImageAlgorithm.h
\until namespace

Include needed header file, and define a namespace alias

\until };
Here's the simplest possible functor, simply setting each pixel to 0.  Note that @c operator() is declared
const, as we pass these functors by (@c const) reference.  If this surprises you, take a look at Meyers,
Effective STL, Item 38.

\until };
This one's a bit more interesting.  We save a value in the constructor, and use it to set each pixel.
It's analogous to @c std::fill, but if I called it @c fill then following a <TT>using namespace std;</TT> the compiler would complain about ambiguity;  it's simpler just to use a different name.

\until };
\until };

Here's are examples of @c pixelOp1 and @c pixelOp2.

\until img2
Declare a couple of Images to play with

\until cout
\until cout
\until cout
\until cout
Apply @c erase to each pixel in @c img1, @c setVal to each pixel in @c img2, set <TT>img1 = img2 + 1</TT>,
and finally <TT>img1 /= img1</TT>

\until }
