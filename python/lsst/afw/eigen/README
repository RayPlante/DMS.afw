The files numpy.i and pyfragments.swg come straight from the numpy distribution, but I'm not sure that they
are always present.

We should refactor all this code, moving eigen.i and eigenLib.i (both of which RHL wrote) into
e.g. lsst.utils.  At the same time, we should consider using numpy.i/pyfragments.swg directly from numpy.
