The file printers.py provides some support for inspecting LSST datatypes from gdb

The python pretty printing's in a bit of a state of flux, but this code works with gdb 7.2 if you build it
with python support (the same python as we're using!) and put:

python
try:
    import lsst.afw.gdb.printers
    lsst.afw.gdb.printers.register(None)
except ImportError:
    pass
end

in some .gdbinit file.  There are better ways of doing this loading coming in future versions of gdb.
